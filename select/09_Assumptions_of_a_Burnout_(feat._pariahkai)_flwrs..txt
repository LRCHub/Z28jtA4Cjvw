You could say I'm lazy
You could say this or that on the daily
Lonely on Monday, lonely on Friday
Catch me a ride, now I'm smokin' down the highway

Give me a chance then I'll be alright
In the dashin' light when I'm losin' time
Need a helpin' headlight, I'm so dead inside
Do you wanna ride? Do you wanna go tonight

You could say I'm lazy
You could say this or that on the daily
Lonely on Monday, lonely on Friday
Catch me a ride, now I'm smokin' down the highway

I don't want no worries, no worries, no
I don't have no worries, no worries, no
I don't want to run away (Run away, away, away)

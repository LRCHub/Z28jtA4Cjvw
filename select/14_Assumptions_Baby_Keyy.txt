My name really bussin'
Glock on me, keep a Russian
Fucked up in a function missing you baby we we're something
I was really on my dumb shit
Should of never even done it
Ion really got no time bae and you keep making these assumptions
Okay
The things that we do ain't the same
Messed up so many times but I changed
For the better
And I know you don't believe and I know that it hurts
Let me take you to the mall buy you a new Prada purse
And I know what you want
And I know what you're worth
Uh, uh
Lately I've been trippin' but I swear I been learned
Uh, uh
Money on my mind but you're still in my world
Yeah
Why we always gotta argue (man that shit crazy)
Ion really wanna argue no more
We've been on and off baby (for real)
I don't wanna feel lost baby
My name really bussin'
Glock on me, keep a Russian
Fucked up in a function mixing you baby we we're something
I was really on my dumb shit
Should of never even done it

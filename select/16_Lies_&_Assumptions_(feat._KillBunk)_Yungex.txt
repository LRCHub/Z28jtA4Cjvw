Damn, I'm tired of running
Only thing you gave me were some lies and assumptions
I don't think I need you in my life, I don't want this
You thought you could play me, right
(You don't want this)
Yeah, would you save my day
Yeah, would you make it okay
My hearts been caved in, I pray
For a better days, nah, a better place

You let your heart out with regret
I stopped and told you I don't wanna be friends
This ain't the first time they been in my head
(What you say to me, would you lay with me)

Yeah, fuck it I can't care
Yeah, you was in my bed with my hands in your hair
Yeah, and now there's just a stare
Fuck it, money everywhere
Couple hudreds I might spare
And it's dark and you ain't here
I can't tell you what's on my mind
Yeah, thinking of the things you probably wouldn't write
Think I'm obsessed with death cause I don't wanna live life
Think I'm obsessed with drugs cause I just wanna die

Damn, I'm tired of running
Only thing you gave me were some lies and assumptions
I don't think I need you in my life, I don't want this
You thought you could play me, right
(You don't want this)
Yeah, would you save my day
Yeah, would you make it okay
My hearts been caved in, I pray
For a better days, nah, a better place

You let your heart out with regret
I stopped and told you I don't wanna be friends
This ain't the first time they been in my head
(What you say to me, would you lay with me)

(Yeah, what you say to me)
Every little time I die inside
Every single time I see you cry
Never gonna change my time
This just a waste of time
You know I'm crazy for ya
I'm never changing for ya
Take flight like angels soaring
And then again we will fall
I ain't ever met nobody just like you
I just wanna spend all my days beside you
So let's leave today, I'm planning escape
(I'm planning escape)

Damn, I'm tired of running
Only thing you gave me were some lies and assumptions
I don't think I need you in my life, I don't want this
You thought you could play me, right
(You don't want this)
Yeah, would you save my day
Yeah, would you make it okay
My hearts been caved in, I pray
For a better days, nah, a better place

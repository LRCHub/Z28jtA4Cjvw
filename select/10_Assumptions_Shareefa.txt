Good evenin church, I'd like to welcome yall to the new DTP community baptist church. Today I'll be
speakin from the good books of assumptions. Ya know, I ran into a good friend of mine, Mr. Jeff Dixon,
and we got to talkin and carryin on, and he said "You kno Shareefa, ya kno a guy came up to me the otha
day, and told me to watch out fa you" And I said, "Why is that Jeff?" He said, "You know, he said you was
a little bit crazy, you was a little troubled" And you know what I told him?

They don't know me well, they don't know me

See the problem with some people
They neva stop to think about my situation
Always quick to make some assumptions
Us females tend to deal wit emotions
Is it the fact that I can be game?
And I can peep a snake from a mile away
You should neva judge a book by its cover
This cant go on no further

Oooh, ya think ya know me, wait a minute
Baby hold up, you don't know me
So sick and tired of people judgin me
Oooh, ya think ya know me, wait a minute
Baby hold up, you don't know me
So sick and tired of people judgin me

Now it seems strange, most of da time
When people have no one to blame they mention my name

Tryna drag it down through the dirt, for what its worth
Forget to mention how I put in work
Up under pressure I was so damn hurt
You should think before you speak
Know whats goin on before you talk about me

Oooh, ya think ya know me, wait a minute
Baby hold up, you don't know me
So sick and tired of people judgin me
Oooh, ya think ya know me, wait a minute
Baby hold up, you don't know me
So sick and tired of people judgin me

Know that I heard that she's fine
People say she be wilin out
Nowadays when I'm up in da hood
In da barbershop they talkin like
"She's no good"

Oooh, ya think ya know me, wait a minute
Baby hold up, you don't know me
So sick and tired of people judgin me
Oooh, ya think ya know me, wait a minute
Baby hold up, you don't know me
So sick and tired of people judgin me
